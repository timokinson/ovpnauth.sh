make it executable (chmod +x) and make sure you can execute it

2) create a file named ovpnauth.conf and put it inside for example
	/usr/local/etc/

3) for each user you want to register
	3a) compute md5 checksum using this ovpnauth.sh md5 password
	3b) add line in your ovpnauth.conf that reads like this:
		username=[computed-md5-password]
	    where [computed-md5-password] is md5 checksum you computed 

4) edit ovpnauth.sh and make sure your conf path (path to ovpnauth.conf) is correct
	4a) (optional) you can change your logfile path

5) now in your openvpn.conf add this options
	script-security 2
